TOUCH BOARD AUDIO

You can easily change the sounds on the Touch Board. The audio files are stored on the micro SD card. To change the sounds:

1. Disconnect the power to the Touch Board, pop out the micro SD card and plug into a computer (you might need a micro SD card reader for this).
2. Move the original Audio Guide tracks off the micro SD card either to a safe place on your computer, or into a folder on the microSD card.
3. Choose 12 new audio tracks in mp3 format and move them onto the micro SD card.
4. Rename them TRACK000.mp3, TRACK001.mp3, TRACK002.mp3 etc... up to TRACK011.mp3.

The appropriate track will play when the associated electrode is pressed, for example E0 = TRACK000.mp3, E1 = TRACK001.mp3 etc. E0 to E11 run left to right along the top of the board.

AUDIO GUIDE TEXT

Hello
E0 - Congratulations! If you're hearing this message your Touch Board is live! The Touch Board has a lot of interesting features and we're going to tell you about them. Press the next electrode to continue.

E for electrode
E1 - The Touch Board has 12 electrodes numbered E0 to E11 that behave like individual sensors. These are inputs that trigger sounds when you touch them.

Audio and power
E2 - So you've clearly got it working. Don't forget, you can play audio through headphones or speakers and you can power the Touch Board from either a micro USB cable or a rechargeable LiPo Battery.

Switching sounds
E3 - So you want to make a dog-bark piano or a cookie jar siren? No problem. You can easily change the sounds on the Touch Board, audio files are stored on the micro SD card. Always disconnect the power first, then pop out the micro SD card and plug into a computer. New files must be in MP3 format and use a special naming system that assigns them to an electrode. To find out more about this naming system, check out the README file on the SD card.

Green for go
E4 - There are three LED lights located near the on/off switch that tell you what's going on. When you power up, a green light means good to go. A red light means you've touch an electrode and an orange light glows when the battery is charging if a USB cable is also connected.

Reset button
E5 - The reset button is your friend. It's a tiny button located next to the clipped corner at the bottom right of the Touch Board. Every time you connect something new to the electrodes you need to recalibrate the board. Press this button, wait for the red light to stop flashing, then you are good to go.

Make a sensor
E6 - Now the fun part! You can extend from the Touch Board to create sensors anywhere. Connect something conductive, like a wire or paperclip, to electrode E0. Press the reset button to calibrate, then touch the wire or paperclip and see what happens.

Make lots of sensors
E7 - Why stop at one? Try connecting to a few electrodes using the examples shown on the box. You can use conductive thread, tin foil, copper tape, alligator clips, wire, paper clips, the conductive foam in the box, Electric Paint or anything else you can think of! Electric Paint provides a great way of creating graphical interfaces with the Touch Board. You can paint directly to the electrodes and use stencils or even screen printing to bring your images to life.

Arduino compatibility
E8 - The Touch Board uses the Arduino programming environment. The board also features the Arduino Leonardo pin layout so that you can attach headers and plug on Arduino shields.

Advanced applications
E9 - To all you advanced users, why not replace the Touch Board code or write your own? You can turn the electrodes into distance sensors, use the Touch Board as a MIDI interface, set individual electrode thresholds, output a continuous stream of electrode data or set up the Touch Board as a Human Interface Device. This is only the beginning!

Mounting
E10 - Check out the dark side of the Touch Board, it perfectly flat to easily integrate onto all your projects. You'll find two mounting holes beneath E0 and E11 and a plated hole at the bottom left corner, in case you need to attach it securely. The third hole also doubles as a ground.
