# Switches and triggers

## What is a switch?

There are many different switches, and they are all based on the same principle. When a  circuit is "open" or interrupted, there cannot be a circular flow of electrons. If you change something, the circuit is "closed" meaning there's a loop so electricity can flow, turning on the devices in the circuit.

Looking at schematic representations of electronic switches give you a basic idea of how they work.

## Triggers

The little modules are switches that are not manually controlled (e.g. by pressing a button with your finger), instead they are controlled by a contextual change. E.g. the light changes, the device is tilted, or senses the presence of a magnet. The modules contain multiple components such as an analog sensor, resistors, and a chip. As a whole, the module is created to *act as a switch*. When the device is manipulated, it sends out a HIGH signal (voltage in the circuit > 0V), which can trigger for example an audio file to play, or turn a light on.
